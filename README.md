### Pandas Assignment

This assignment part 1 asked me to analyze the portfolio saved in starter code folder, and find out which portfolio is a better investment.

This assignment part 2 asked me to custom a portfolio, I used the csv file that already saved in starter code folder to organize my own portfolio and do the analysis.
After that, I need to summarize if my portfolio is a great investment.
